This project was to set up a library app and let users to store their books and keep track of which book has read or not yet.

The data is stored in localStorage and only accessible on the computer that it was created on.

- localStorage - setItem, getItem and removeItem
- Follow the "DRY" (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
